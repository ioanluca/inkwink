# InkWink 
## About
* Photography website design mock-up
* Built only with native HTML and CSS as this was a requirement
* Doesn't have any functionality, was only made for presentation purposes
* I was responsible for the Gallery and the Forum sections

## Known issues 
* Routing, forum and gallery functionality are all simulated; Hence, there's no real functionality
* May look weird on some screens as it was meant to be presented only once in a lifetime, on a specific screen
