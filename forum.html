									<p>I have no idea as I am just an enthusiast. <br><br>
But it seems with the internet, dwindling print media and so on, there does not seem many opportunities for young people now. <br><br>
I guess you could carve out a niche business in weddings,portraiture, product photography etc, but you need business skills and cash to do this.
I ask this because I was chatting to a friend who is a veteran journalist who in recent times is expected to take photos as well. He is a lousy photographer, plus they issue very entry level equipment, he is pulling the pin and becoming a high school teacher.

									<p>Yes you can, if you really want to. However, the hours you put in, will return an annual income of significantly less than they would in other professions, so you really have to take pleasure in undertaking photography to warrant sacrificing the money you could make elsewhere or in a salaried job with benefits, pensions, sick leave, holiday pay, etc, etc...
<br><br>So, in short you can survive from photography, but you won't be wealthy or even an above average earner.<br><br>
The problem is photography isn't difficult, (sorry to all the old time pros on dpreview who think they're creative geniuses). Therefore the value people put on it has crashed through the floor. Gone are the days where amatuers took fuzzy, grainy and bland photos and pros took stunning images. These days technology and learning mediums have advanced so much the gap between the images of a pro and those of an amateur with a $500 camera and not too many spare time hours of practice/learning, is actually very small.
<br><br>My advice, get a salaried job/career and do photography part time as a well paid hobby, and undercut all the full time pro's prices to win customers. That way you'll have financial security from your real job, and at the same time a very well paid hobby that you enjoy.
