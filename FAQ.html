			<h1><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h1>
			<ul>
				<li type="disc">
					<h2>What software should I invest in?</h2>
					<p  align="justify">If you are going to invest in photo editing programs then Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom are the way to go. If money is a problem than try GIMP or Picasa. These are two free programs that are out there that offer some great editing features without leaving your pockets empty.</p>					
				</li>
				<li type="disc">
					<h2>Can you explain how filters work?</h2>
					<p>Filters provide an extra protective layer to the camera's lens as well as help with lighting problems. Simply screw the filter onto the front of the lens and you're done.</p>
				</li>
				<li type="disc">
					<h2>What are some good resources for a beginning photographer?</h2>
					<p>Follow the blogs of fellow photographers that work with similar subject matter. Most photographers are happy to answer questions and blog about mistakes they've made. This is a great way to learn and make friends with fellow photographers.</p>
				</li>
				<li type="disc">
					<h2>What camera and lens should I start out with?</h2>
					<p>You can ask this question to any photographer and you're bound to get a different answer each time. Essentially what you are looking for is a beginner DSLR camera that will grow with you as you learn. Nikon and Canon are two of the most popular brands of cameras, with Sony coming in very close in 3rd place.</p>
				</li>
				<li type="disc">
					<h2>Should I be shooting in RAW or JPEG?</h2>
					<p>The main difference between RAW and JPEG is the file size and quality. RAW photos keep most of the camera data, but the files are much larger than the compressed JPEG format. If your camera can shoot in RAW and you have the software to process the images then shoot in RAW. JPEG may be the better option if you are shooting large quantities of photos and you need access to them quickly. It really boils down to your needs as a photographer.</p>
				</li>
				<li type="disc">
					<h2>Do I need a tripod?</h2>
					<p>Yes, and a shutter release wouldn't hurt either. Tripods help keep everything steady and looking clear. You don't need to invest in an overly expensive heavy one either. There are some great tripod options in the $20 to $25 dollar range on Amazon.</p>
				</li>
				<li type="disc" class="last">
					<h2>Do I need more than one memory card?</h2>
					<p>It's always a good idea to have a backup memory card. Memory cards like to stop working when you need them the most.</p>
