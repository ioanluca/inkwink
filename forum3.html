										Hello, I've been researching into photography and all its terms and dslr's in general for well over two weeks now, and I know I want to buy a Nikon D7000 and plan to do
										landscape and take pictures on vacation, as well as taking pictures of my dog and similar things
										like that and can't decide on a lens to buy I've considered just starting out with a kit lens and
										later on purchasing other superior lens to eventually replace it, buying a 35mm 1.8, as
										well as a nikkor 16-85mm dx, this last one would be ideal however it is a little more on the pricy side than I was wanting
										to spend if you have any reccomendations they would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

										I would look at the Sigma 17-70 F2.8-4 C <br><br>
										http://www.photozone.de/nikon--nikkor-aps-c-lens-tests/822-sigma1770284os <br><br>
										At 70mm and F4 you get a decent head and shoulders portrait lens. While the 17mm at the wide-end makes it a bit wider then most kit lenses. <br><br>
										Great performance especially when stopped down a bit helps out too. <br><br>
										Price is $399,- <br><br>

										Hi - do you have a particular dealer/deal in mind?  I'm not sure how it works for the newer cameras,
										 but I don't think you'll find anyone offering a new D7000 with a choice of kit lens at this stage in its career -
										  I would be very happy to be wrong about that, mind.  And I am inferring that your after a body + kit lens deal, rather than "body only" plus lens/lenses to suit.<br><br>
I've just had a look at ebay UK, and there are plenty of kit offers.  The 18-105 seems to be the lens offered most frequently, but there are a couple of two-lens deals - 18-55 VR
(not the most recent version) + 70-300.  My guess is the 18-105 was the original kit lens with the D7000.<br><br>
On the other hand, there are loads of D7000 body only offers.  They are mainly 2nd hand, but I saw at least two "new" - both very close to Â£390.

										Anybody shed any light on whether the 16-85 was ever offered as a kit lens, and if so what with?<br><br>
I think you need to think very carefully about how important that extra 2mm is at the wide end - it doesn't sound much, but it really is a significant difference.
 If you want that extra width, I would suggest you think about body only and get the 16-85 separately.  I don't think it's likely to be cost effective to get a D7000+18-105 bundle, and then add a 16-85 as well.<br><br>
And if anybody wonders how I come to have both the 16-85 and 18-140 in my gear, a) it's a long story and b) neither were bought as part of a kit!<br><br>
