His travel and tourism guide website put Ukraine on top of the list, followed by Sweden, Thailand, Bulgaria, Russia, Netherlands, Lebanon, Poland, India, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Serbia, South Korea, Croatia, Columbia, Argentina, Ethiopia and Romania.</p>
				<p align="justify" class="text">Romanian women have been described as elegant, educated, active, caring, empathic, feminine, developing positive attitudes and promoting traditional values. According to the guide website, the Romanian women have all that a man is searching when choosing a wife. They are also known for their native intelligence and for giving priority to culture and personal development during their life, dr. Prem also writes.

				<div class="photograph"></div>
				<p align="justify" class="text">For Sweden, it is considered to be the country with the best looking men and women in the entire world. "Tall and slender, blonde and blue eyed, smart and friendly, and highly educated. That's what would describe a Swedish woman. Probably the best place to get a girl with both the beauty and the brains!'. For Thailand, he said in his travel and tourism guidebook that it might be known for its nature, culture and hospitality, but it is also known for its beautiful women who are shy, but extremely friendly and romantic once they come to know you though. 'A tad bit dark skinned, these beauties sport soft features and exude a jaw dropping raw exoticism that needs to be seen to be believed!' reads the description.</p>
				<p align="justify" class="textlast">However, dr. Prem mentioned that "We agree that every women is beautiful regardless of country she lives in".</p>
