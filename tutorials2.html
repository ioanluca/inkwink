                <h2>Perfect Planning</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">he reality is that the majority of the time when you are on the road, you will be pushed for time, and even more so if there are unforeseen circumstances like delays or poor weather. To ensure that you can maximize your time in each location, you have to plan as much as possible for every trip. Start off by creating a detailed shot list, then break down your trip day by day, and even hour by hour. Work out the direction of light at different times of the day, and think about the best time to photograph. If you are photographing somewhere or something that has been photographed a lot, browse through stock image libraries at what already exists, and think how you can make your shot unique. Remember to always have a back-up plan in case you have a poor weather day.
Every little detail that you can pre-plan will enable your time to be used more efficiently while you are away.</p>
                <h2>Settle in Quickly</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">As a travel photographer, you have to be able to hit the ground running as soon as you reach your destination, so the ability to settle in quickly to a new place is a must. There’s no time for culture shock or jet lag, even though that is not always easy if you are in a new place, and travelling alone. The only way to combat this is to practice, and the more places that you experience, the greater confidence you will acquire in new environments.</p>

                <h2>Strong Visual Analysis</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">A majority of time, the difference between a good photo and a great photo, is simply the composition. Add a person walking into a scene, and it suddenly comes alive, where before it looked ordinary. You have to be able to look at a scene, critique it in your mind, and ask yourself how you can make it look better. A technique that I like to use is to imagine where that photo might be used. Is it going to be in a double page spread in a magazine? If so, do I place my point of interest on the left or right? Try to get into the habit of making every shot you take your best.</p>
                <h2>Strong Social Skills</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">Travel photography is about capturing different cultures, and big part of that are the people. You need to be able to move beyond any shyness, and build connections with people quickly, even if you don’t speak their language. It is incredible how receptive and friendly people are when you make the effort to talk to them – especially when they find out you are from a different country.</p>
                <h2>A Love of Travel</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="textlast">It probably goes without saying, that to be a travel photographer you need to love to travel. While most people love going on vacation, not everyone enjoys travelling. There is no time for sunbathing by the pool, or spending an afternoon sitting in a bar. It’s all about experiencing things, and finding those unique moments that capture the story.

Travel photography is a very lonely, tiring and high-pressure profession. But it is also an incredibly exciting, and rewarding branch of photography, which can really make you see and experience a destination more than the average tourist. To succeed you’ll need all the skills above, and more!
