            <h1><b>Understanding Color of Light</b></h1>
            <p class="author1">By Oded Wagenstein</p>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Color as a visual storytelling element</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">What we perceive as color is actually our brain’s interpretation of light reflected off objects and transmitted to the brain via our optic nerves. Under the field of color psychology, a range of studies have shown that colors can deeply affect how we experience the world around us, from the taste of the food we eat, to how we respond to new brand packaging on supermarket shelves. Colors affect how we feel, and this is precisely why understanding color is so important to you as a photographer.</p>
                <h2>Blue Light (about 11000K)</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">                    When: Before sunrise and after sunset.
                    Common emotional effect: Glum and mysterious, with a sense of coldness.
                    Take it to the next level: If you are in an urban environment, try mixing the natural blue light with the artificial orange light from street lamps to create an amazing color combination and depth (which will be later explained).
                    Please note: Due to the low level of light during this time of day, pay close attention to your shutter speed to avoid blurry images.
</p>

                <h2>Golden Light (about 3500K)</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">                    When: It depends on your location on earth, but golden light is usually around sunrise and sunset.
                    Common emotional effect: Praised by photographers as the golden or magic hours, with soft, pastel-like warm colors of red and yellow. Portraits and landscape images will seem almost magical.
                    Take it to the next level: By standing higher than your subject, shooting from an angle of 45 degrees, you can achive a wonderful catch light (a spark of light in the eyes of the subject) due to the reflection of the sky in the subject’s eyes. (see image below)
                    Please note: As with any type of magic, you need to be swift and efficient. Plan your daily schedule carefully. For example, if you want to shoot during the golden light of sunrise, you must get up early. Very early.
</p>
                <h2>Midday Light (between 5000-6500K)</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="text">                    When: It depends on your location on earth, but usually from one hour after sunrise until one hour before sunset.
                    Common emotional effect: This light seems neutral in color to the eye, even though it’s considered a cold color in terms of Kelvin degrees. The contrasts caused by midday light will amplify objects’ colors. So, vibrant objects will seem even more vibrant and vice versa.
                    Please note: You can enjoy the amplifying benefits of midday light without the harshness if you place your subject indoors near a window.
</p>
                <h2>Cloudy Day (about 7000K)</h2>
                <p align="justify" class="textlast">                    When: When the sky is heavily overcast.
                    Common emotional effect: Similar to that of blue light with a glum, winter-like feeling, but stronger and brighter, allowing you to work with faster shutter speeds.
                    Please note: The biggest benefit of working on a cloudy day is the continuity of color tone throughout the day. This means there’s less pressure on you to work as fast as possible, as you would need to do at other times of the day, like the golden hours.
