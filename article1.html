			<h1><b>Trip to Portugal!</b></h1>
			<p class="author1">By Paul Bernhardt</p>
			<div class="article">
				<p align="justify" class="text">Visiting Portugal is to discover a remarkably diverse destination. Inextricably linked with the sea, the country has more than 800 kilometers of enticing Atlantic Ocean coastline. Lisbon, the capital city, enjoys a stunning location near the mouth of the River Tagus. From here, trailblazing mariners set sail in the 15th and 16th centuries on epic voyages of discovery, and Portugal has nurtured a proud seafaring tradition ever since.</p>
				<p align="justify" class="text">Portugal's interior melds dramatic northern mountain ranges with the vast rolling plains of the country's sun baked central regions. In the south, some of the best beaches in Europe flank picturesque coves and warm, shallow waters. Dotted throughout are stone-built villages, enchanting towns, and cosmopolitan cities where historic palaces and castles, museums and monasteries are waiting to be explored. And traveling to Portugal can also mean a visit to the verdant, subtropical island of Madeira - the "Garden Isle" - or the isolated, but tranquil Azores archipelago.</p>
				<div class="photograph"></div>
				<p align="justify" class="text">Belem is synonymous with Portugal's golden Age of Discovery. It's from the shores of this Lisbon suburb that intrepid navigators set sail in the 15th and 16th centuries on long and perilous voyages to chart unknown waters and map new territories. One such mariner, Vasco da Gama, discovered the sea route to India in 1498 and to honor his achievement, King Manuel I commissioned a monument that became a lasting symbol of the country's astonishing era of conquest and expansion. Today, the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos is one of the country's most cherished and revered buildings, and a "must see' on every tourist's agenda.</p>
				<p align="justify" class="textlast">The church and monastery embody the spirit of the age, and feature some of the finest examples of Manueline architecture found anywhere in Portugal; the beautifully embellished decoration found on the South Portal is breathtaking. Inside, the beautiful cloister is equally exuberant. Appropriately, the church houses the tomb of Vasco da Gama and other national figureheads, including Luis de Camoes, Portugal's greatest poet and chronicler of the discoveries.</p>
